***===BIRD SPOTTER 2020===***

///===USER STORY===///

  Bird Spotter 2020 is an accuity / reflex game, similar to whack-a-mole and Duck Hunt. 

  A sample round of gameplay:
    
  (1) landing splash / title with brief objective desctiption (spot birds by clicking on them! spot as many as you can before time is up!) and 'start' button
    
    player clicks 'begin' button
    
  (2) field of play appears: 10x10 grid of various cover types is drawn in randomly. The type of cover determines what sort of bird may appear from behind it. 

  (3) Birds begin to emerge, one at a time. Timer begins counting down from 30. A bird emerges once every two seconds and each type of bird has specific behaviors. Crows will *peek* from behind trees, left or right. Doves will *spook* from bushes, diagonally up and left, straight up, or diagonally up and right. Kiwis will *hop* behind their cover and then *scoot* left or right. One bird will appear on screen at a time and leave / be removed before the next appears. 

  (4) Player attempts to mouseover as many birds as possible in 30 seconds.
  
  (5) When the countdown ends, a time up message appears. 
  
  (6) Score screen appears - visually displaying the birds the player spotted, and showing a top score and the player's current score.
